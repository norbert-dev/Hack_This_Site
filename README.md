# Hack_This_Site

Within this repository I will try to guide you thru the Hack This Site missions.

I am currently learning CEH and ethical hacking as well as Pentesting and Web-Development.

Feel free to use these tutorials if you get stuck. I am trying to make it as natural as possible so everyone can understand it.

New items and folders will be added constantly to this repo so feel free to follow.

Everything here is strictly educational purposes only.

Originaly none of the materials here are malicious but I can not take responsibility for changed code parameters.
