# Hack_This_Site

Within this repository I will try to guide you thru the Hack This Site missions.

I am currently learning CEH and ethical hacking as well as Pentesting and Web-Development.
For codeing I use mainly Python but also I am not afraid of a little bash programing as well. 

Writing HTML5, CSS3, MongoDB or MeteorJS a little <?php> is just fine. If intrested check my repos. 

Also learning GO, Ruby, COBOL. 

And just for the record JavaScrip and myself are like Batman and Joker. :)

On OS level Kali, Parrot, and windows is what I am using but mainly Parrot and Win10.

Other than that english is my second language so my appologies for any mistakes I accidentaly made.

Feel free to use these tutorials if you get stuck. 
I am trying to make it as natural as possible so everyone can understand it.

New items and folders will be added constantly to this repo so feel free to follow.

Everything here is strictly educational purposes only.

Originaly none of the materials here are malicious but I can not take responsibility for changed code parameters.
