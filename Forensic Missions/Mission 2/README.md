Mission description (detailed)::

	My client is being accused of cheating on his wife. 
    A photograph has been presented in court that shows him with another woman 
    in their bedroom, in their home. The woman in question is a known friend to them both. 
    My client has stated that he did take the photo. However, he claims it was a "selfie" 
    and no other person was present in the home or in the picture.

How do we get started?
	
First as always read the mission carefully because in most cases it does give you hints where to go.

The first hint is that when the client says that he did take a picture but it was a selfie. 
Lets assume we believe him. 

Then only one thing comes into our mind. Digital image manipulation.

Here comes ELA in play. 
ELA stands for <strong>Error Level Analysis</strong>.

There are many options to check ELA but
    
    https://fotoforensics.com/
    
is far the easiest. On FFCs site just copy paste the given selfie photo url link. 
Upload it and check for ELA.
    
If you hover the mouse pointer over the uploaded pic this is what you get.
    
And there it goes.
