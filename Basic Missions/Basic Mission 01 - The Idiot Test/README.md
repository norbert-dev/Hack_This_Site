# Description
This level is what we call "The Idiot Test", if you can't complete it, don't give up on learning all you can, but, don't go begging to someone else for the answer, thats one way to get you hated/made fun of. Enter the password and you can continue.

# Solution

This is a nice warm up task.

Just open page sorce code `F12`

Select the `Inspector Tool`

and click inside the password input field.

Inside the sorce code view you will find a line containing this line

`<!-- the first few levels are extremely easy: password is 401734c8 -->`

There it is a hardcoded html comment psw string in the code.

Just enter: ` 401734c8` and you are good to go.

# Notes

You have to learn how to use and navigate inside the source code. This is a major part of these task. Also understanding HTML, and js helps a lot in these missions.
