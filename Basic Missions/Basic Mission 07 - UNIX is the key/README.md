# Description

This time Network Security sam has saved the unencrypted level7 password in an obscurely named file saved in this very directory.

In other unrelated news, Sam has set up a script that returns the output from the UNIX cal command. 


# Solution

So in the input field if we enter any year number we get to see a calendar site.

So if you enter year 2000 or 2020 or even 2021 you will se that years calendar.

Epic. But not helping.

So we gonna have to learn some new features as mentiond and as I said already earlier. First READ.

It says `UNIX` commands. well then this first input field must take `UNIX` commands. 

So to see what they have in ` UNIX` we type `ls` this is the equivalent of windows `dir` now if we run only ls inside as it is it won't work.

We need to inject this code with the `;` semi colon mark.

You should be fine reading the files stored ther with the following commands.:

1. `;ls`
2. `;ls -l`
3. `;ls -A`

I won't go into details but these will list a few files in a new window.

You will need
`k1kh31b1n55h.php`
to move on.

Open up this file by typing this extend into the URL like this::

`https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/basic/7/k1kh31b1n55h.php`

And here we are. Your password is `281864a9` @ the presence of this write up.

Paste it and you are good to go for level 8
