General mission overviews:
	
	In this section there are eleven missions listed as per follows:
    	
        Mission 1::
        
        	Basic test of your skills to see if you can do any of these missions. Requirements: HTML
            
        Mission 2::
        
        	A slightly more difficult challenge, involving an incomplete password script. Requirements: Common sense.
            
        Mission 3::
        
        	Some intuition is needed to find the location of the hidden password file. Requirements: Basic HTML knowledge
        
        Mission 4::
        
        	An email script has been set up, which sends the password to the administrator. Requirements: HTML knowledge, an email address
        
        Mission 5::
        
        	Similar to the previous challenge, but with some extra security measures in place. Requirements: HTML knowledge, JS or FF, an email address.
        
        Mission 6::
        
        	An encryption system has been set up, which uses an unknown algorithm to change the text given. Requirements: Persistence, some general cryptography knowledge.
        
        Mission 7::
        
        	The password is hidden in an unknown file, and Sam has set up a script to display a calendar. Requirements: Basic UNIX command knowledge.
        
        Mission 8::
        
        	The password is yet again hidden in an unknown file. Sam's daughter has begun learning PHP, and has a small script to demonstrate her knowledge. Requirements: Knowledge of SSI (dynamic html executed by the server, rather than the browser)
        
        Mission 9::
        
        	The password is again hidden in an unknown file. However, the script that was previously used to find it has some limitations. Requirements: Knowledge of SSI, unix directory structure.
        
        Mission 10::
        
        	This time Sam used a more temporary and "hidden" approach to authenticating users, but he didn't think about whether or not those users knew their way around javascript...
        
        Mission 11::
        
        	Sam decided to make a music site. Unfortunately he does not understand Apache. This mission is a bit harder than the other basics.
        

Mission completion rules::
