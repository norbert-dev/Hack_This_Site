# Description
Sam has gotten wise to all the people who wrote their own forms to get the password. Rather than actually learn the password, he decided to make his email program a little more secure.


# Solution

Same like level 4. Just replace the e-mail address to your own and hit the send email button.

`<input type="hidden" name="to" value="sam@hackthissite.org">`

PS:: Under thor onion this is not working.

Then you will get a pasw reminder e-mail in my case the code was:: `cacad092`

Easy win.

Off we go to level 6
